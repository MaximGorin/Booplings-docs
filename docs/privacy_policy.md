# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: July 22, 2025*

The purpose of this Privacy Policy ("Policy") is to describe how the Booplings macOS application ("Booplings", "we", "our", or "us") handles user information. Booplings is committed to respecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws.

By using our application, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the application.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

Booplings **does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data**. The application operates entirely on your local device. Specifically:

* **Interaction data** such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses are counted **locally only**. This data is stored on your device and is not transmitted to any external server.
* **Preferences**, such as the selected character, screen position, and character size, are stored locally for convenience. These settings are not synced or accessed remotely.
* The application does **not** access your contacts, location, microphone, camera, or any other personal or system data.
* No user registration or login is required, and no identifiable information is requested or stored.

---

## 2. Use of External Services

Booplings uses a minimal external check to retrieve the latest available version of the app from the App Store. This request:

* Is performed anonymously
* Does **not** include personal data or device identifiers
* Is used solely for comparison with the current version to inform the user of updates

No other third-party services are integrated into the application.

---

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since Booplings does not collect personal data, there is **no data sharing** with third parties. No data is transferred across borders or processed outside the user’s device.

---

## 4. Data Retention

Booplings stores data locally on your device for as long as you use the application. This includes interaction counters and preferences. All such data remains under your control and is deleted automatically if the application is uninstalled.

---

## 5. Your Rights

Because Booplings does not process or retain personal data on external servers, rights such as access, correction, or deletion of personal information are **not applicable**. You are in full control of all stored data through your operating system.

---

## 6. Data Security

Booplings does not transmit data over the internet. Local storage of preferences and counters is handled using the standard, secure system APIs provided by macOS. While no system is completely immune to vulnerabilities, Booplings does not introduce additional data-related risks.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on the application’s GitHub Pages website. Your continued use of the application constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
